\section{Installation}

Requirements Julia version >= 0.7, with the following packages installed:
\begin{itemize}
\item FFTW
\item SpecialFunctions
\item Libxc (a wrapper to Libxc {\footnotesize \url{https://gitlab.com/libxc/libxc}}
\item LibSymspg (a wrapper to spglib {\footnotesize \url{https://github.com/atztogo/spglib}}
\end{itemize}

These packages are registered so they can be installed by using Julia's package manager.

\begin{juliacode}
using Pkg
Pkg.add("FFTW")
Pkg.add("SpecialFunctions")
Pkg.add("Libxc")
Pkg.add("LibSymspg")
\end{juliacode}

These packages should be automatically installed when
\txtinline{PWDFT.jl} is installed as local package (see below).

Currently, this package is not yet registered.
So, \jlinline{Pkg.add("PWDFT")} will not work (yet).

We have several alternatives:

Using Julia's package manager to install directly from the repository URL:

\begin{juliacode}
Pkg.add(PackageSpec(url="https://github.com/f-fathurrahman/PWDFT.jl"))  
\end{juliacode}

Using Julia development directory. We will use \txtinline{$HOME/.julia/dev}
for this. To enable \txtinline{$HOME/.julia/dev} directory, we need to modify the Julia's
\txtinline{LOAD_PATH} variable. Add the following line in your
\txtinline{$HOME/.julia/config/startup.jl}.

\begin{juliacode}
push!(LOAD_PATH, expanduser("~/.julia/dev"))
\end{juliacode}

After this has been set, you can download the the package as zip file (using Github) or
clone this repository to your computer.

If you download the zip file, extract the zip file under
\txtinline{$HOME/.julia/dev}. You need to rename the extracted directory
to \txtinline{PWDFT} (with no \txtinline{.jl} extension).

Alternatively, create symlink under \txtinline{$HOME/.julia/dev}
to point to you cloned (or extracted) \txtinline{PWDFT.jl} directory.
The link name should not contain the \txtinline{.jl} part. For example:

\begin{textcode}
ln -fs /path/to/PWDFT.jl $HOME/.julia/dev/PWDFT    
\end{textcode}

(Alternative) Install PWDFT.jl as local package.
Firstly, get into Pkg's REPL mode by tapping \jlinline{]},
and activate a independent environment `activate .` .

Install the PWDFT.jl package in this environment:

\begin{textcode}
(PWDFT) pkg> develop <path/to/PWDFT.jl>
\end{textcode}

To make sure that the package is installed correctly, you can load the package
and verify that there are no error messages during precompilation step.
You can do this by typing the following in the Julia console.

\begin{juliacode}
using PWDFT
\end{juliacode}


Change directory to \txtinline{examples/Si_fcc} and run the following in the terminal.

\begin{textcode}
julia run.jl
\end{textcode}

The above command will calculate total energy of hydrogen atom by SCF method.

The script will calculate total energy per unit cell of silicon crystal using
self-consistent field iteration and direct energy minimization.

Units

\txtinline{PWDFT.jl} internally uses Hartree atomic
units (energy in Hartree and length in bohr).
